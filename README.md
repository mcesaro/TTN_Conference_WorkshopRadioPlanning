# TTN-Conference Workshop Radio Planning
This repository holds the workshop content of the workshop radio planning at The Things Conference January 2020 in Amsterdam.

# About the workshop
This workshop will deliver a hands-on experience in simulating coverage of LoRaWAN gateways. It will not cover the complete cycle of the Radio Planning process.
The workshop duration is 45 minutes.

## Preliminary knowledge
Participants shall have intermediate knowledge of the LoRaWAN standard, antennas, and dB calculations. As an RF engineer you know about receiver sensitivity and antenna gain.

## Learning objective
After this workshop the participant:
- knows about simulation of radio signal propagation,
- has basic knowledge of link budgets, 
- knows how to model a LoRaWAN gateway and node in the software installed on a Windows laptop.

## Requirements
To participate in the workshop the participant requires 
- a __Windows__ laptop on which he can run the RF simulation software. 
- Any other OS is not supported during the workshop!
- The laptop shall have WiFi and a USB port. 
- Administration rights are not required.

## Workshop structure
The workshop is divided in to 3 parts: 
1.	Installation of radio simulation software. 
2.	Setup a Link budget and discuss the individual parts of the Link budget. This will result in building blocks to be used in Radio Mobile.
3.	Exercise the use of Radio Mobile, simulate the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway and what effect changes in the link budget have when we change parameters.
